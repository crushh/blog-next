## February 1, 2023

I was asleep until 4 Am because I struggled with my nose.

Yes, I have a flat nose. A flat nose is generally a result of a lower nasal bridge.

The nasal bridge is lower for many people, particularly those of Asian descent.

I was somewhat tempted by rhinoplasty.

But I changed my mind when I searched for a doctor.

I saw a lot of pictures of the girls after surgery.

The nose looks beautiful in the pictures were a bit exaggerated for me.

I start reflecting on one thing, do I need to alter my nose to make me look better?

I have baby fat on my face, my brow bone is very low if my nose becomes high nose bridge looks very incongruous.

Plus the risks and after-effects of having a rhinoplasty.

I don't want to expand so much money and time just on a nose which probably makes me look better.

I think I am pretty right now.

In the future, maybe I will be unconfident again, but that is for the future me to fix.
